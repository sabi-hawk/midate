# MERN Project Readme

## Overview

This is a MERN project structured with separate client and server directories for effective organization.

## Project Structure

root directory:
src: Contains the client-side React application code.
server: Houses the Node.js and Express server code.
package.json: Manages project dependencies and scripts.
## Setup

Install dependencies:
In the root directory, run npm install.
In the server directory, run npm install.
## Running the Application

Start the client-side:

In the root directory, run npm start. This will typically launch the React development server.
Start the server-side:

In the server directory, run npm run dev:server. This will execute the Node.js server in development mode.
## Accessing the Application

Once both the client and server are running, access the application in your web browser, typically at http://localhost:3000 (or the port specified in your server configuration).

## Additional Notes

Environment variables: If your project utilizes environment variables, ensure they are set appropriately for both the client and server environments.
Database configuration: If applicable, configure your MongoDB connection within the server-side code.
Testing: Consider implementing a testing framework to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
Production deployment: For deployment to a production environment, consult relevant documentation for your chosen hosting platform and adjust configurations as needed.
